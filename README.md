# Multi Layer Perceptron using just Numpy

This is an implementation of MLP or Multi Layer Perceptron, more commonly known as a Dense Neural Network using just Numpy.

I currently have no idea how I am going to do this. Let's see!

First prototype is ready! Though I have to clean the code.

The backprop algorithm (according to my very basic testing), after training for 1500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01 results in 93.7% success rate over 1000 attempts, and 93.0% success rate with 500 epochs in training.

There may be many inefficiencies in the system right now as it is the limit of my knowledge right now and I am therefore looking for suggestions on how to improve it.
